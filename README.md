# Invisible Treehouse - Music Streaming Platform with NFT Marketplace
## Overview
Invisible Treehouse is an innovative music streaming platform that incorporates a built-in NFT marketplace, empowering artists to upload and distribute their music directly to listeners worldwide. With the added benefit of leveraging IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for streaming, artists can share their creations seamlessly and without intermediaries. The platform also enables artists to mint their uploaded songs as ERC1155 tokens with the option to set a limited quantity of up to 10,000. Additionally, artists have the opportunity to establish ongoing royalty fees of up to 10% for future transactions involving their music NFTs.

## The Problem in the Music Industry
Traditionally, artists have faced significant barriers when trying to get their music on popular streaming platforms. The reliance on distributors introduces delays of approximately one month before their music becomes accessible to the broader audience. Moreover, after their songs are streamed, artists often have to endure lengthy waiting periods of 4-6 months before receiving their due compensation. These inefficiencies hinder creativity, stifle earnings, and create a gap between artists and their listeners.

## How Invisible Treehouse Solves the Problem
Invisible Treehouse is revolutionizing the music industry by eliminating the need for intermediaries. By offering artists direct access to the platform, they can upload their music effortlessly, bypassing the cumbersome distribution process. This means that their songs become instantly available to a global audience, saving valuable time and reducing frustration.

Furthermore, with the integration of the NFT marketplace and ERC1155 token minting capabilities, Invisible Treehouse empowers artists to monetize their music in an entirely new way. By minting their songs as NFTs, artists gain ownership control and can set the quantity of their music NFTs, offering exclusivity to their supporters. Additionally, the ability to establish ongoing royalty fees for future transactions ensures that artists are rewarded continuously for their creations, promoting a sustainable income stream.
